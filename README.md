# Personal Trainer Web Application

This project is a CRA-bootstrapped TypeScript port of an earlier course project, whose repository 
along with a more detailed(for now) readme.md can be found here:

https://github.com/Cho-ui/Personal-Trainer-React-Front

The project will be used as a learning tool in implementing various technologies to a web application,
including styling, logic and end-to-end testing, git workflows, docker etc.

The most immediate step in further development will be uncoupling the project from it's current
course-work related REST Api, and building a similar solution for CRUD use with the .NET Core Framework. 
Once this has been achieved, both projects will be moved to a shared overall project folder for clarity.
Deployment will also be done at that point.
